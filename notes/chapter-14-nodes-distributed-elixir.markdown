# Nodes and distributed Elixir

## Nodes and Naming

**node**: is a running instance of the VM. `mix` or `iex` commands create nodes.

By default, each node is isolated. For two nodes to connect, each must have a **name**.

Nodes are named with short names (`fred@quarry`) or long ones (`wilma@quarry.foobar.com`). Typically, you use short names if your nodes run on the same computer, long names otherwise. But, you can't mix them.

Nodes try to connect the first time one references another.

Connections are transitive. It means that if two nodes are connected, and a third node connects to just only one of them, the three nodes are connected to each other (everything connects to everything).

Programming in Elixir is almost always location (network) transparent.

If a node sends a PID (local PID) to another node, it'll be *converted* into a **remote PID** (it will contain the process PID and the node id).

There are several ways to identify a process:

- The PID
- A registered name (with `Process.register(pid, :my_process)`)
- A name + a node name: `{ pid, :<node name> }`
- A remote PID

So, you can use whatever you want to send messages to a process
