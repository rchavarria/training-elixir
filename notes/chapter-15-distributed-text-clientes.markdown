# Distributed text clients

## A quick API change

The change to using a separate process in the Hangman application broke nothing, just a small change in the API that needs a small correction in `lib/text_client/mover.ex`. Great!



## From server to service

## Use Hangman API without starting a server

## Start remote server when TextClient starts
