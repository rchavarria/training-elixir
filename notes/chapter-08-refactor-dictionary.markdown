# Refactor the Dictionary

## Our dictionary module needs help

The first code we wrote was the dictionary module. It was nice, tidy, code. But it didn’t follow our standards. In particular, the full implementation was in lib/dictionary.ex. That’s not the way we do things around here, pardner.

In this unit we’ll rectify this. Or, to be more accurate, you’ll rectify it. You do the work, and then you can watch me do the same thing in the next lesson.
